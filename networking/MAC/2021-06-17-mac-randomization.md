# MAC Randomization

Just like IP address, MAC can also be randomized. Having a static IP enabled folks to create their own device fingerprinting database. 

iOS 14 introduced MAC Randomization changes, that result into not only using a random MAC address when scanning for SSIDs and access points (known as probe request) but also use a randomized MAC address when connection to the SSID. Also, change the randomized MAC address every 24 hours.
