# Pubkey authentication with SSH

SSH authentication can be enabled with pubkey only. for this you need to edit /etc/sshd/config file. Also, for the generated public and private keys, only the public key needs to be copied using `ssh-copy-id -i <key-name> <server>` command. The key will be appended in `.ssh/authorized_keys` file on server.
Any user who is logging in should have the private key.
This makes sense as well, the user proving his identity needs the private key only and the server verifying the identity needs the public key only.
